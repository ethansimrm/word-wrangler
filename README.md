# word-wrangler

This is my basic re-creation of a word wrangler game in the CodeSkulptor browser-based IDE, which was created by the Rice University Department of Computer Science. 

Given a word (in the Scrabble dictionary), guess all the other words its component letters could form!

This programme implements merge sort, intersect, and duplicate removal. A recursive generator of all possible strings from a word is also implemented.

Due to the highly specific nature of the GUI, it only works in CodeSkulptor - you can access it at https://py2.codeskulptor.org/#user48_GSEbk7cIuf_41.py.
